# Energy Demand Modeling: Nigerian Household Load Profile

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates professional energy demand modeling skills by analyzing the electrical load profile of a typical Nigerian household. The analysis provides insights into consumption patterns, peak demand characteristics, and optimization opportunities in an intermittent grid environment.

## Professional Context

Energy system management requires understanding demand patterns to optimize supply, reduce costs, and improve reliability. This analysis models a real-world scenario common in many developing economies where grid reliability varies throughout the day.

## Technical Approach

The analysis follows a systematic methodology:

1. **Data Modeling**: Creation of appliance inventory with technical specifications
2. **Load Profiling**: Development of 24-hour demand patterns based on usage behaviors
3. **Grid Reliability Modeling**: Incorporation of intermittent supply characteristics
4. **Financial Analysis**: Cost calculations based on current market rates
5. **Visualization**: Professional charts for technical and business audiences

## Key Deliverables

- **24-Hour Load Profile**: Visual representation of demand patterns
- **Energy Metrics**: Consumption, peak demand, load factor calculations
- **Cost Analysis**: Daily and monthly energy expenditure projections
- **System Recommendations**: Actionable insights for optimization

## Technical Specifications

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Analysis Type**: Time-series energy modeling
- **Output Format**: Professional visualizations and data exports
